This is a repository for demonstration purposes of Lesson 5 in IT 332: Integrative Programming and Technologies.

In this mini example, we are featuring <b>Squirtle</b>, the Small Turtle Pokémon. For this example, I want you to modify the HTML file, adding more to the contents such as the Evolution, Trivia, and Stats.

The instructions on how to contribute on this repository are found in the Instructional Module of the Versioning and Version Control topic.

To start:
<ul type = "disc">
    <li>Download Git <a href = "https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>.</li>
    <li>The Git Bash will be installed along with Git, that will also be used for entering Git commands.</li>
</ul>

Feel free to experiment with the files. I hope this will be a helpful for you in learning the basics of Git as well.
